# Capstone Project Plan
_Please enter your project information below for your capstone project idea and your plan for completion_

# Outline
#### Basic Description of your project/idea
- We are going to try to recreate Asteroids. It is a spacecraft that aims to destroy as many asteroids as possible. If you make it far enough UFO's will spawn that can shoot you back.

#### Additional Details, how you envision it working, important notes to consider, etc...
- You will spawn in the middle and astroids will be around you, your goal is to shoot as many as possible while dodging them. Once they get shot they break apart. By making it far enough their will be UFO's that spawn that creates an additional challenge of dodging their bullets.

#### Features we MUST include
- Movement, shooting, three lives, asteroids, death animation

#### Feature we would like to include
-  UFO's, asteroids breaking apart, and score

#### How will you incoporate each of the following:
**Module 1 - Variables and Output**
- A variable will be used to control speed, how many lives remaining, and have a max of asteroids that can spawn.

**Module 2 - Object Orientation and Inputs**
- We will be using methods for shooting, creating asteroids, and creating UFO's

**Module 3 - Math, Returns, and/or Constructors**
- We will use math for the rockets movement, radnom speed for asteroids, and constructores for size and colour.

**Module 4/5 - Conditionals and Loops**
- Check if the bullet is colliding and  a forever loop to create the asteroids

**Module 6/7 - Arrays OR ArrayLists**
- To keep track of the asteroids

**Module 8 - Optional: 2D Arrays**



#### Language, Code, Platform you plan to use?
- Processing and VS Code

#### Basic idea of split of work? Tasks assigned to each ohter?
- Mario - Asteroids
- Mark - Bullets
- Leo - Lives
